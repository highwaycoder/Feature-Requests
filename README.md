# Feature-Requests

A repository for lists of feature requests for popular software I wish I could submit to the developers

## Rationale

Many times, I get ideas for improvements to software that I can't do anything with.  Rather than let them go to waste, I decided to collate them into a git repository on the off-chance anybody saw them and considered them useful.

## Guidelines for submission

Fork the repo, commit a change, submit a pull request.  Simple.

I reserve the right to reject submissions without reason given, although I am a reasonable bloke and will try my hardest to explain any rejections.  Most likely, it's because you didn't follow my conventions and I'll just ask you to re-format the submission (or if I'm feeling particularly generous, or the submission is of great value, I'll reformat it myself).

## Permissible software

Any software which doesn't already have a feature request system in place is allowed.

Software which does have a feature request system in place is allowed, but not recommended - I'd prefer it if you submitted your requests directly to the developers in these cases.
