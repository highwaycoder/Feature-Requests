The FRL (Feature Request Language) syntax is fairly simple.  It's a markup
language based on XML, and includes the following tags:

Root tag: <frl>

<headers> signifies the beginning of the meta-information in the file
<header> is a header (duh) and accepts the following attributes:
  name: the name of the header (required)
The content of this tag is used as the content of the header.

Recognised headers are:
 author: the name of the author of the file
 copyright-year: the year in which the file was created (can be a range of
years)
 description: a description of the file

<requests> signifies the beginning of the requests proper
<request> is a request and accepts the following attributes:
  name: the name of the request (required)
  short-description: a brief outline of the request (optional)
The content of this tag is used as the long description of the request

Here is a brief example file to show you what's what:
=== FILE BEGINS ===
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8?>
<!DOCTYPE frl SYSTEM "frl.dtd">
<frl>
  <headers>
    <header name="author">Chris Browne</header>
    <header name="copyright-year">2012</header>
    <header name="description">An example feature request file</header>
  </headers>
  <requests>
    <request name="Foo" short-description="I would like to see more foo in this
software">Really, the software doesn't have enough foo and should have more foo
because there's nothing quite like foo to keep software from becoming terrible
abandonware.  Not enough foo!</request>
    <request name="Bar">This exemplifies a request without a short description.
 These requests are quite legitimate, don't you worry!</request>
  </requests>
</frl>
